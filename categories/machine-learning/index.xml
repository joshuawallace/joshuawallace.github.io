      <description>In my research, I look for planets around stars in a certain type of star cluster known as a globular cluster. Globular clusters are the oldest known star clusters and are nearly as old as the universe. Although the locations of many of these clusters are well known and documented, interloping stars that happen to be in the same area of the sky as these clusters are always present in telescope images.</description>
