      <title>Collisional Fragmentation is Not a Barrier to Close-in Planet Formation</title>

      <description>Article Description The final stage of rocky planet formation involves giant impacts between planet-sized bodies. For planets in regions around where Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars are in our solar system, it has previously been shown that such collisions, while epic, are still of sufficiently low velocity to allow for mergers to dominate over fragmentation and thus for planets to be able to form. In this paper, we show analytically that, depending on the exact value of some parameters, this may or may not be the case for regions very close to stars (much closer than Mercury is to the Sun), though the values we think are correct show that planet formation is possible.</description>

      <title>Detecting the Supernova Breakout Burst in Terrestrial Neutrino Detectors</title>

      <description>Article Description Core-collapse supernovae are profuse emitters of tiny particles called neutrinos. We calculate how well neutrino detectors on Earth would be able to detect a specific feature in the neutrino emission from a nearby supernova, the &amp;ldquo;breakout burst.&amp;rdquo; For this project, I created a Monte Carlo code to simulate detection of the breakout burst across a variety of neutrino detector types and at a variety of supernova distances.</description>

      <description>Article Description For my undergraduate thesis, I investigated how Lyman-alpha emission is affected by and correlated with the environment from which it is emitting. We used a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code and basic prescriptions of anisotropy in a gas cloud&amp;rsquo;s density and/or velocity and then analyzed how these environmental anisotropies affected the emission strength and frequency of the Lyman-alpha photons.</description>
